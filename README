The computing scientistâ€™s main challenge is not to get confused by the
complexities of his own making.

    ~ E. W. Dijkstra

Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology
because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against
complexity.

    ~ David Gelernter
